"""prelude_undo: changes(), diff() and undo() — PRELUDE fragment 2/5e.

WHAT IT IS
  Raw child source `_UNDO`: the session change list, the text diff and undo (restoring the
  pre-cell bytes of the last journal rows). prelude_journal.py concatenates it last, so it sees
  the journal and snapshot state.

ENTRY POINTS
  _UNDO   source text; inside: changes, diff, undo

INVARIANTS
  fragment, not an API: undo() restores through `_commit`'s journal data, so its refusals and
  restored/up-to-date shapes stay exactly as before.

WHERE TO CHANGE
  change list, diff text, undo restore ... changes, diff, undo
